# Feedback on iExec iApp Generator & iExec Tech - "Sum" Project (ETH Belgrade Hackathon)

**Project:** Sum - Confidential Employee Pulse Surveys
**Date:** June 5, 2025

## Overall Experience

Our overall experience using the iExec iApp Generator and related iExec technologies (specifically the `@iexec/dataprotector` SDK and the Bellecour network) for the "Sum" project was largely positive. The tools enabled us to quickly prototype and implement a confidential computation use case within the limited timeframe of the hackathon.

## iApp Generator Tool

**What went well:**

*   **Ease of Scaffolding:** The iApp Generator (`iapp init`) was straightforward to use for scaffolding the basic structure of our iApp. The command-line interface was intuitive.
*   **Clear Instructions (Generally):** For the most part, the documentation for getting a basic iApp up and running was easy to follow, especially the core commands for initialization, building, and deploying.
*   **Local Testing Capabilities:** The ability to test the iApp locally before deploying to the sidechain was very helpful for debugging the core application logic (e.g., our aggregation algorithm for survey responses).
*   **Docker Integration:** The use of Docker to package the application simplifies dependency management and ensures a consistent execution environment, which is a strong point.

**Areas for Potential Improvement / Challenges Encountered:**

*   **Docker Cache Issues:**
    *   **Specific Feedback:** We encountered a situation where stale Docker cache seemed to cause unexpected behavior or prevent updates in our iApp from being reflected correctly during local testing or deployment.
    *   **Recommendation:** It would be beneficial if the documentation or the tool itself provided a more explicit recommendation or command to clean the Docker cache (e.g., `docker system prune -a --volumes` or more targeted iExec-related cache cleaning) when developers are iterating rapidly or troubleshooting unexpected iApp behavior. A small note in the troubleshooting section or a flag in a build/test command could be helpful.
*   **TEE Integration Details (TDX/SGX):**
    *   While the generator handles much of the complexity, more detailed examples or explanations in the documentation regarding how data flows into and out of the TEE, and what specific considerations are needed for TDX/SGX environments (beyond just enabling the experimental feature), could be beneficial for developers new to confidential computing. (e.g., memory limitations, specific library compatibilities within the TEE).
*   **Error Message Clarity (Minor):**
    *   [Optional: If you encountered any specific error messages that were unclear, mention them here. E.g., "On one occasion, an error during `iexec app deploy` gave a generic message X, and it took some time to figure out it was due to Y."]

## Other comments

**What went well:**

*   **Hello World:** This walk-through helped surface initial challenges that were quickly addressed with the help of the team at the event.

*   **EVM Compatibility:** The EVM compatibility made it easy to think about potential smart contract interactions, even if our core iApp logic was [JavaScript/Python - specify what you used].

**Areas for Potential Improvement / Challenges Encountered:**

*   **SDK Documentation Examples:**
    *   While the core functions are documented, more end-to-end examples in the SDK documentation showcasing a complete dApp flow (e.g., data protection -> grant access -> process data -> retrieve results) with both frontend and iApp snippets would be invaluable, especially for hackathon participants.
    *   Specifically, clear examples on how the `owner` of the protected data (employee) grants access to an `appAddress` for a specific `authorizedUser` (the admin wallet for a survey project) would be great.
*   **Managing `taskId`s:**
    *   In a scenario where an admin might trigger processing for multiple protected data objects, managing the multiple `taskId`s and associating them back to the original data requires careful client-side logic. Any utilities or patterns suggested by iExec for batch processing or `taskId` management would be a plus.
*   **Understanding `dataset` vs. individual `protectedData` processing:**
    *   [If applicable: "We initially explored if we could process a 'dataset' of all survey responses for a project in one go, but found the model of processing individual `protectedData` objects (or small batches passed by the client) to be more straightforward with the current SDK examples. Clarity on best practices for batching would be useful."]

## Concluding Remarks

The iExec stack provides a compelling solution for confidential computing. The iApp Generator significantly lowers the barrier to entry for developing TEE-based applications. With minor enhancements to documentation around specific troubleshooting steps (like Docker caching) and more comprehensive end-to-end examples, the developer experience could be even smoother.
